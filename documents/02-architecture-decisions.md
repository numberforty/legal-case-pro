# Architecture Decisions

## Technology Stack Overview

Legal Case Pro is built on a modern, scalable technology stack that leverages the latest advancements in web development. This document outlines the key architecture decisions and explains the rationale behind each choice.

## Frontend Architecture

### Next.js Framework

**Decision**: Use Next.js as the primary frontend framework.

**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering capabilities for improved performance and SEO
- Built-in routing system simplifies page navigation
- API routes allow backend functionality without separate server
- App Router architecture makes feature development more intuitive
- Static site generation options for improved performance
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Strong developer ecosystem and community

### React

**Decision**: Use React as the UI library.

**Rationale**:
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability
- Virtual DOM provides excellent performance
- Widespread adoption ensures long-term support
- Large ecosystem of compatible libraries
- TypeScript integration for improved code quality

### TypeScript

**Decision**: Use TypeScript for type safety.

**Rationale**:
- Static typing catches errors during development
- Improved IDE support with autocompletion
- Better documentation through type definitions
- Makes large-scale application development more maintainable
- Enhances team collaboration with clear interfaces

### Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach speeds up UI development
- Consistent design system through configuration
- Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS
- Easy responsiveness handling
- Excellent theming capabilities

### State Management

**Decision**: Use Zustand for global state management.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler API compared to Redux or MobX
- Minimal boilerplate code
- TypeScript friendly
- Good performance characteristics
- Easier learning curve for new developers

## Backend Architecture

### Next.js API Routes

**Decision**: Use Next.js API routes for backend logic.

**Rationale**:
- Unified repository simplifies deployment
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Reduced context switching for developers
- Serverless functions scale well

### Prisma ORM

**Decision**: Use Prisma as the database ORM.

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database access
- Schema-based approach ensures consistency
- Migrations system simplifies database evolution
- Query builder is intuitive and powerful
- Auto-generated client based on schema

### PostgreSQL Database

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as the primary database.

**Rationale**:
- Robust relational database with ACID compliance
- Strong support for complex queries and relationships
- Excellent JSON support for semi-structured data
- Open-source with wide hosting options
- Mature and proven in production environments

## Authentication System

**Decision**: Use JWT with HTTP-only cookies for authentication.

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication reduces server load
- HTTP-only cookies provide better security than localStorage
- Edge middleware enables efficient auth checking
- Simple to implement and scale
- Works well with serverless architecture

## Development Environment

**Decision**: Use standardized development environment with ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent code style across the team
- Early error detection
- Improved developer experience
- Simplified onboarding for new team members

## Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Use Docker containerization for deployment.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent environments across development and production
- Simplified dependency management
- Portable across different hosting providers
- Scales efficiently with load
- Supports microservices architecture if needed in future

## Future Architectural Considerations

1. **Microservices**: As the application grows, certain components like document management or billing may be split into microservices.

2. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for notifications and collaborative features is planned.

3. **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Redis for caching frequently accessed data will improve performance.

4. **Analytics Pipeline**: A separate data pipeline for analytics is being considered.

5. **Mobile Applications**: React Native applications sharing business logic with the web application.
